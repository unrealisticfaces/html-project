    <h2>What is Diskless System</h2>
        <p>
            Diskless system is comprised of one server computer and multiple client computers that are connected to it over the network. 
            <br> Out of all computers, the server is the only one that has physical drives to store data, including operational system and software installed. While client computers don't have any software on them, they use a snapshot of system configuration that is stored on the server. <br>
            <br> All changes or updates of software that were done on the server computer will bedone on the side of client computers as well. 
            <br>On the other hand, changes done to files and folders of client computers will not have any effect, while also - will be erased after reboot.

    <h2>Is it also applicable to small shops ?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, Diskless setups are definitely applicable and beneficial for small shops, not just limited to high-end or VIP setups.  
        <br> In fact, they can be a particularly smart choice for smaller businesses due to several advantages. <br>

        <br> So, while diskless setups are sometimes associated with high-end gaming cafes or specialized environments 
        <br> they can be a practical and cost-effective solution for small shops as well.
